I had trouble how to properly place the divs and how to float them. 
I watched many youtube videos and went over the videos from class and it was 
very difficult to understand. I really tried and I feel embarrassed that I'm not
able to understand as quick. I gave it my best shot hopefully you're able to 
understand what I did wrong. I'm still having trouble understanding the class id's and 
when to use them. SOS haha
